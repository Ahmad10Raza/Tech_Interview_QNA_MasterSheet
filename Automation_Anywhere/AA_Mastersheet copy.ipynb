    "127. How do you handle UI changes in legacy applications?\n",
    "Answer: Use resilient locators, image-based fallbacks, or adjust automation to API/back-end integrations; implement monitoring for UI drift.\n",
    "128. What is Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in defect management?\n",
    "Answer: Systematic process to identify underlying causes of defects and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence.\n",
    "129. How do you manage Version Control in the Control Room?\n",
    "Answer: Use Control Room project/version features, export/import packages with version tags, and maintain external VCS for source artifacts if supported.\n",
    "130. Explain \"Auto-unlock\" vs. \"Auto-login\" issues.\n",
    "Answer: Auto-unlock releases locked resources automatically; Auto-login handles credentialed login—issues arise when policies or screen locking prevent either, requiring secure handling."

    "## X. Agile & QA Testing (Q131–Q150)\n",
    "131. What is an Agile Sprint, and how long does it typically last?\n",
    "Answer: A time-boxed development iteration (commonly 1–4 weeks) for delivering increments of value.\n",
    "132. Describe the Daily Stand-up meeting.\n",
    "Answer: Short daily sync where team members report progress, blockers, and plans for the day.\n",
    "133. What is a Sprint Planning meeting?\n",
    "Answer: Meeting to select backlog items for the sprint and define the sprint goal and tasks.\n",
    "134. What is a Retrospective Meeting?\n",
    "Answer: Reflective meeting after a sprint to discuss what went well, what didn't, and actionable improvements.\n",
    "135. Explain the difference between Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing.\n",
    "Answer: Smoke testing checks core functionalities end-to-end; sanity testing verifies specific functionality after changes.\n",
    "136. What is the Defect Life Cycle?\n",
    "Answer: States a defect goes through (New, Assigned, In Progress, Fixed, Retest, Closed, Reopened) with ownership and transitions.\n",
    "137. How do you prioritize user stories when time is limited?\n",
    "Answer: Prioritize by business value, risk, dependencies, and effort (MoSCoW or WSJF).\n",
    "138. What is Regression Testing?\n",
    "Answer: Testing to ensure new changes haven't broken existing functionality.\n",
    "139. Explain the 80/20 rule (Pareto Principle) in defect clustering.\n",
    "Answer: 80% of defects often come from 20% of modules—focus testing on high-risk areas.\n",
    "140. What is the Pesticide Paradox in testing?\n",
    "Answer: Repeatedly running same tests becomes less effective; test cases must be refreshed to catch new defects.\n",
    "141. How do you perform Boundary Value Analysis?\n",
    "Answer: Test at, just below, and just above input boundaries to uncover edge-case defects.\n",
    "142. What is the purpose of Unit Testing for a developer?\n",
    "Answer: Validate small code units behave as expected and guard against regressions.\n",
    "143. How do you test Mobile Applications (e.g., Jio App scenarios)?\n",
    "Answer: Use mobile automation frameworks (Appium), emulators/real devices, and test on varied network conditions and OS versions.\n",
    "144. What is the \"Aging Test\" in manual testing?\n",
    "Answer: Long-duration testing to uncover memory leaks, performance degradation, or intermittent failures.\n",
    "145. What is the importance of Client-side vs. Server-side validation?\n",
    "Answer: Client-side improves UX; server-side is critical for security and authoritative validation.\n",
    "146. How do you handle Inconsistent/Intermittent defects?\n",
    "Answer: Collect detailed logs/screenshots, reproduce in controlled environments, add telemetry and increased monitoring, and analyze trends.\n",
    "147. What is Maven, and why is it used in Java-based testing?\n",
    "Answer: Build and dependency management tool that simplifies project builds, dependencies, and lifecycle management.\n",
    "148. Describe OOPs concepts like Inheritance and Encapsulation.\n",
    "Answer: Inheritance allows classes to derive behavior from parent classes; Encapsulation hides internal state and exposes methods to interact with an object.\n",
    "149. Write a Java program to find a Prime Number.\n",
    "Answer: Example (simple):\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class PrimeCheck {\n",
    "  public static boolean isPrime(int n) {\n",
    "    if (n <= 1) return false;\n",
    "    for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {\n",
    "      if (n % i == 0) return false;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return true;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "    int num = 29;\n",
    "    System.out.println(num + \" is prime? \" + isPrime(num));\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "150. Write a SQL query to remove duplicate records based on specific IDs.\n",
    "Answer: Example using CTE and ROW_NUMBER():\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH CTE AS (\n",
    "  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY unique_col ORDER BY id) rn\n",
    "  FROM my_table\n",
    ")\n",
    "DELETE FROM my_table WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM CTE WHERE rn > 1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Answer summary: Use ROW_NUMBER to mark duplicates and delete where row number > 1."
